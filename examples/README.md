# Stelling examples

This module contains a skeleton for a stelling based project.
The codebase contains two entrypoints: a long running daemon and a job.

The goal is to provide a guideline on how to structure the code, load config
and produce a system. The code has been thoroughly commented to explain what
is going on at each point.

Detailed information on the capabilities of each module, can be found in the 
module README and example tests
