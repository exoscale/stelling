# Stelling

A collection of opinionated golang scaffolding packages.

The various packages in this module can be used standalone, but are optimised to work together, to make it easy to create long running processes in Go.

Documentation for each package is included in the package README.

## Basic Usage
Apart from the config package all modules are meant to be used with the [fx package](https://pkg.go.dev/go.uber.org/fx).
